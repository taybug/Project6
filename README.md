CIS 376 Project6
 This project has the followin in it:
 For this project you will develop a crisp, clean, and functional web page deployed on GitHub pages w/ReadMe.md of the page's behavior.  

Requirements:

DIRECTORY - single index page, filenames, logical directories. No spaces in filenames/directories. 

HTML - a full viewport (not full page) image (kind've like on https://bobikesbama.com) in grayscale or black&white, with an imported font and wording positioned on the lower-right side of the image. (Essentially this is a 'splash screen'). 

CSS - all styles in the css. viewport breakpoint functionality to change the image size when the viewport shrinks. Styles must have consistent and logical naming with proper use of class and id. 

JS - must use jQuery. some animation on load, an event listener to support some interaction with the user on the page. Example: Clicking on the wording makes it animate.  

All code sufficiently commented to be clear of how the page is supposed to work.

**additional requirments will be given on case-by-case per submisison.
